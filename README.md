# Deploying to DigitalOcean

After you run this project locally using [`Run Project` button](#running-locally), deploying to [DigitalOcean](http://digitalocean.com/) is very simple.

First, be sure you have SSH keys configured in your machine. If you don't have it yet (or if you aren't sure about it), just follow steps 1 and 2 of [this tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/).

Next, put your [personal access token](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/settings/applications) into a `.env` file:

```bash
$ cd path/to/the/project
$ echo "DEPLOY_API_TOKEN=<YOUR-PERSONAL-ACCESS-TOKEN>" >> .env
```

Then, just run the following:

```bash
$ azk shell deploy
```

The `Run Project` button employs `azk`, a lightweight open source orchestration tool that will automatically isolate and configure the application's environment for you.

Find instructions for further resources (mostly customizations) to deploy to DigitalOcean using `azk` [here](http://docs.azk.io/en/deploy/README.html).
